<h2 id="basic-elevator-behaviour-outline">Basic Elevator Behaviour Outline</h2>
<p>A SOLE elevator behaves as follows:</p>
<p>A person on floor x requests an elevator so they can move to floor y. <br />
Receiving a request causes an elevator to start moving to floor x to pick up the person.<br />
The elevator reaches floor x and stops, allowing the person to get onto it.<br />
The elevator moves the person to floor y and stops, allowing the person to get off.</p>
<p>Additional requests are ignored until the elevator completes the first request it receieves. </p>
<h3 id="basic-elevator-example-scenario">Basic Elevator Example Scenario</h3>
<p>Assuming one elevator idle at Lobby:</p>
<p>1) Person A at floor 2 requests an elevator to move them to floor 1.<br />
2) Elevator at Lobby receives request and begins to move to floor 2<br />
3) Elevator reaches floor 2, stops, and picks up person.<br />
4) Person B requests an elevator to move Person B to Lobby [Request is ignored].<br />
5) Elevator (person A onboard) begins moving to floor 1.<br />
6) Elevator (person A onboard) reaches floor 1 and stops, letting person A off.<br />
7) Elevator is now idle and can repeat step 1 for a new request.</p>

<hr />
<ul>
<li>Boarding an elevator takes 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Leaving an elevator takes 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Elevator prepares for 1 second in an "about to do x" state before doing x.</li>
<li>Acceleration is instantaneous</li>
<li>Elevator base velocity units are +1 m/s, 0 m/s or -1 m/s.</li>
